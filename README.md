## âš¡Home Energy Consumption Monitor with LCD Display

Welcome all! In this repository, you will hopefully find everything you need to carry out the **Home Energy Consumption Monitor** project. 

This design involves the implementation of an **STM32F103C8T6 BluePill MCU** to monitor and display electrical parameters such as:
- Current
- Voltage
- Power factor
- Energy consumption in kWh  

The information is shown on a display, allowing real-time readings of measurements. The system also includes an **alarm (LED)** to warn about critical values and to protect against overvoltage and overcurrent.

## ðŸš€Key Features

### Energy Consumption Monitoring:
- Current and voltage measuring through sensors connected to the BluePill's ADC.
- Real-time energy consumption calculation in kWh.

### Power Factor:
- Phase shift measurement between the current and voltage signals.
- Power factor calculation.

### Data Transfer:
- Real-time gathered data displayed on an LCD 16x4 using I2C.

### Alarm System:
- LED indicator triggers when Power Factor or Energy Consumption values exceed recommended thresholds.

### Energy Usage Optimization:
- Provide users with sufficient information to make informed decisions and reduce energy consumption at home.
