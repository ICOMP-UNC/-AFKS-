/**
 * @brief Configures ADC pins and initializes DMA for sensor data acquisition.
 *
 * This function performs the necessary configuration to set up the ADC to read values
 * from the sensors connected to the specified ADC channels. It configures the GPIO pins
 * for ADC input, enables the ADC and DMA peripherals, and sets the required sample times
 * for accurate sensor readings.
 * 
 * It initializes the DMA to transfer the sensor data efficiently and stores the samples
 * in a buffer for further processing. The ADC channels, DMA settings, and sampling times
 * are configured according to the application requirements (e.g., voltage and current sensors).
 * 
 * The function should be called once at the start of the program to initialize the hardware
 * before any ADC readings are taken.

/**
 * @brief Reads the sensor data from the ADC buffer and calculates the average values.
 *
 * This function reads the sensor data from the ADC buffer and calculates the average
 * values for the voltage and current sensors based on the collected samples. It processes
 * the ADC data to obtain the sensor readings in the desired units (e.g., voltage in V,
 * current in A) and returns the calculated values for further processing or display.
 * 
 * The function should be called after the ADC samples have been collected and stored in
 * the buffer. It processes the data to obtain the sensor readings and returns the calculated
 * values for use in the application logic.
 * 
 * @return An array of floating-point values containing the average sensor readings.
