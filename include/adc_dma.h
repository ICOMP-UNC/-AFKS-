/**
 * @brief Configures ADC pins and initializes DMA for sensor data acquisition.
 *
 * This function performs the necessary configuration to set up the ADC to read values
 * from the sensors connected to the specified ADC channels. It configures the GPIO pins
 * for ADC input, enables the ADC and DMA peripherals, and sets the required sample times
 * for accurate sensor readings.
 * 
 * It initializes the DMA to transfer the sensor data efficiently and stores the samples
 * in a buffer for further processing. The ADC channels, DMA settings, and sampling times
 * are configured according to the application requirements (e.g., voltage and current sensors).
 * 
 * The function should be called once at the start of the program to initialize the hardware
 * before any ADC readings are taken.
